November 1, 2022 - Implementing the popular game in the browser console, FOR NOW. With further plans on revisiting this project to add GUI to it.

January 27, 2023 - JavaScript Project from The Odin Project curriculum. 

First, I had to create a rock, paper, scissors game that was only played in the console. I decided to use this project to put all my current knowledge to practice - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I did not have a clear final project goal, so it evolved over time. I had to re-work my HTML structure a couple times, until I was satisfied with the design of the page. The functionality that I created with javascript was added bit by bit. As I would complete one part, I would notice sometime else that I wanted to do. Therefore, my code feels a like I threw spaghetti on the wall. I am hopeful that with more experience, I will be able to develop DRY and clean code.
